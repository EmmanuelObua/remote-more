## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Node.Js Server API

Navigate to the server directory and run `npm run dev` to start the server

After starting the server, on the main directory, run `npm start` to start the angular application to feed on the API

## Adding records to test the app
- Start by adding stores, when adding store it's perfect to provide an address recognised by google maps since it's decoded on the backend to cordinates.
- After adding stores, you can now add products of each store
- At this point you can now view the app data which will prompt you to allow access to your location to list nearby stores.
